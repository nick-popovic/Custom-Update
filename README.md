# Custom-Update
Simplified package manager that unifies Debian (APT) and Arch Linux (Pacman/Yaourt) package managers into a singular CLI and determines which to use based on the OS.


## Features (so far):
- run update->upgrade->cleanup process for APT package manager

## TO-DO
- Impliment Arch Linux's Pacman/Yaourt package manager automation and cleanup
- Detect OS and run the appropriate package manager (right now it detects nothing)
- Impliment 'install' feature so user may access program easily
  - Impliment 'unistall' feature
  - Impliment 'upgrade' feature
